# Transformer-based-fouling-factor
This project applies a Transformer-based deep learning model for forecasting the fouling factor in heat exchanger systems, a key parameter affecting energy efficiency in industrial processes. Fouling leads to reduced heat transfer performance, increased maintenance costs, and unscheduled downtime. Thus, accurate prediction of its behavior is crucial for proactive maintenance and process optimization.

## Problem Statement
Fouling in heat exchangers builds up over time and impacts thermal performance. Traditional modeling approaches struggle with capturing its non-linear, dynamic nature. In this project, we employ a Transformer-based time series model to capture long-range dependencies in the data and predict the fouling factor with high accuracy.


## Result
In this case, we have 500 Training Data and 4732 Forecasting Data with a Resultant Value of RÂ²=0.8543
